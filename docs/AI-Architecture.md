IV. AI ARCHITECTURE (SAFE, SCALABLE, DEFENSIBLE)
This is a regulatory moat, not a feature set.
 
Core Architecture Principles
•	Human-in-the-loop by default
•	Immutable audit logs
•	Jurisdiction-aware logic layers
•	Model abstraction (LLM-agnostic)
•	Zero training on firm data without consent
 
Key Components
•	Intake NLP → structured schema
•	Rules engine (state / county / court)
•	AI supervision layer (flags, warnings, confidence)
•	Secure vector storage per firm
•	Explainability + citation verification
 
Why This Matters
When courts and bars restrict AI usage:
•	VeriLex is compliant by default
•	Competitors scramble to retrofit trust
