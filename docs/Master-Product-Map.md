VERILEX MASTER DOMINATION PLAN
How VeriLex Becomes the Category-Defining Legal AI Platform
 
I. PRODUCT ROADMAP (EXECUTION-READY)
This roadmap is structured to create irreversible advantage as early as possible.
 
Phase 1: Wedge & Lock-In (0–12 Months) - - - - In Progress
Objective: Become the default “new case engine” for small firms.
Core Product (Must-Have)
•	AI-guided conversational client intake (chat + form hybrid)
•	Structured data extraction at intake (facts, dates, parties, jurisdiction)
•	Practice-area–specific intake logic (start with Family Law)
•	County-level rules engine (Georgia all 159 counties)
•	Case preview & risk flags before acceptance
•	Client document upload with auto-classification
•	Immutable intake → case record creation
Differentiator
VeriLex starts where all other platforms begin too late.
KPI Targets
•	Time to intake completion ↓ 60–80%
•	Attorney intake review time ↓ 50%
•	Intake abandonment ↓ 40%
•	Case rejection accuracy ↑ (less bad clients)
 
Phase 2: Workflow Ownership (12–30 Months)
Objective: Move from intake → daily operations.
Expansion Modules
•	Deadline & timeline automation (court + statute driven)
•	AI task engine (who does what, when)
•	Smart document assembly (jurisdiction-aware)
•	Client communication automation
•	Evidence & exhibit organization
•	Matter-level AI summaries updated in real time
Result

Objective: Turn data into advantage.
Advanced Capabilities
•	Judge analytics (motion success, timing, tendencies)
•	Outcome prediction (risk bands, likely timelines)
•	Firm-specific AI fine-tuning
•	Case portfolio analytics
•	AI malpractice risk detection
Result
VeriLex becomes decision infrastructure, not software.
